### When will I receive my JetKVM?

**We don't know.** We understand the wait can be frustrating, but rest assured, we are working around the clock to get your packages out.

For more context:

As the delivery of your JetKVM pledge depends on so many factors, **mostly out of our control**, we can only provide you with a rough estimate of the dispatch of your device.

**December Batch:** Less than 0.47% of this batch is still pending. These are mostly orders requiring manual handling due to unusual delivery requirements. If you haven't received a shipping email, please [contact us](mailto:shipping@jetkvm.com).

**January Batch:** Fewer than 0.58% of these pledges are left. Like the December batch, these are mainly orders with special manual handling needs or unique shipping destinations. If you haven't received a shipping email, please [contact us](mailto:shipping@jetkvm.com).

**February Batch:** We are actively shipping these orders right now. If you haven’t received a shipping confirmation yet, hang tight - it’s on the way. **Please don't reach out to us with simple shipping status inquiries.**

**March Batch:** We expect this batch to be dispatched in March, with no delays. **Please don't reach out to us with simple shipping status inquiries.**

**Important Reminders:**

- If you haven't received an email yet, it just means your reward hasn't been packaged & processed yet. Hang tight, we'll get to you as soon as possible!

- We don’t ship all rewards at once. Instead, **shipments go out continuously starting in the target month**. If your order is in a pending batch, rest assured we’ll get to you soon!

- If you ordered any extensions, **we will very likely ship them separately from your main JetKVM device**. You'll receive another notification when your extensions are ready to ship.

### Which batch am I in?

The batch you're in depends on the backer number.

- **December**: Less than 12208
- **January**: 12208 - 15303
- **February**: 15304 - 19415
- **March**: 19416 - 30447
- **April**: Larger than 30447

### How do I know when my package will be dispatched?

Once a package is dispatched from the factory in Shenzhen, China, you will receive an email at the shipping email address you provided in the backer survey. Please ensure you've completed the survey.

We will also send you updates via email as your package makes its way to you. A tracking link will be provided once the reward has been handed over to the local courier.

If you haven't received an email, it means your reward hasn't been shipped yet.

### Kickstarter vs. Retail

JetKVM remains a Kickstarter-backed project, meaning delivery timelines are estimates rather than fixed retail shipping dates. We are preparing for retail availability, but we are not there yet.

Your support made this product possible, and we appreciate your patience as we work to deliver it to you.

### I entered the wrong shipping country during my pledge

If you selected the incorrect shipping country when making your Kickstarter pledge and are now unable to correctly complete the backer survey, please contact our shipping team at [shipping@jetkvm.com](mailto:shipping@jetkvm.com).
We'll help resolve this issue and ensure your shipping details are properly updated.

### Can I still make a pledge?

**Yes!**

You can make a late pledge to the campaign on [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/jetkvm/jetkvm?ref=5sxcqi).
Rewards from late pledges will be part of a March 2025 batch of devices.

### Will there be a retail version of JetKVM? How much will it cost?

**Yes**, we're currently in talks with Amazon to sell the JetKVM.

We plan to **keep the $69 price**, before shipping and taxes.
The final price will vary based on your location and available shipping options.

### I never provided my shipping address. How do I do that?

To ensure everything is properly tracked in Kickstarter's system, you'll need to submit your address through the Kickstarter backer survey.

You should have received an email with the survey link, but you can also access it directly here: [Kickstarter Survey Link](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/jetkvm/jetkvm/backing/survey_responses) (make sure you're logged into the correct Kickstarter account).

This process helps us stay organized and ensures your JetKVM is shipped to the right place!

### What courier will you use?

Unfortunately, we can't specify the courier for any country, as shipping is handled by a third-party service rather than directly by us. If this is a critical requirement for you, and you'd like a refund, please reach out to [shipping@jetkvm.com](mailto:shipping@jetkvm.com). When we go retail in March, details like this will be much clearer.

### Will you be able to handle the demand?

**Yes!**

Batch production has been happening throughout November 2024, and we have secured the components needed to meet the
projected order volume.

### Can I change my pledge?

Unfortunately, we're unable to make changes to pledges after they've been submitted. The pledge you made is final and cannot be modified, even at the shipping stage.

However, you have a few options:

1. **Refund and Reback**: I could refund your pledge, and you could back the project again with updated items. Please note that this may result in a later shipping date, so be sure to check the Expected Delivery date.
2. **New Account Option**: If you don't mind paying extra for shipping, you can create a new Kickstarter account and back the project again with the updated items.
3. **Wait for Retail**: Alternatively, if you're not in a rush, we plan to launch the product for retail on platforms like Amazon starting in February. This might be a more convenient option.

Reach out to [contact@jetkvm.com](mailto:contact@jetkvm.com) if you'd like to discuss these options.

### Can I edit my shipping address?

Prior to shipping your reward, we'll send you an email to verify your shipping address. You'll be able to review, edit, and confirm your address at that time.
