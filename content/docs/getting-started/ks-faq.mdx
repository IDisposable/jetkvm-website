### Can I still make a pledge?

**Yes!**

You can make a late pledge to the campaign on [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/jetkvm/jetkvm?ref=5sxcqi).
Rewards from late pledges will be part of a January or February 2025 batch of devices.

### Will there be a retail version of JetKVM? How much will it cost?

**Yes**, we're currently in talks with Amazon to sell the JetKVM.

We plan to **keep the $69 price**, before shipping and taxes.
The final price will vary based on your location and available shipping options.

### I never provided my shipping address. How do I do that?

To ensure everything is properly tracked in Kickstarter's system, you'll need to submit your address through the Kickstarter backer survey.

You should have received an email with the survey link, but you can also access it directly here: [Kickstarter Survey Link](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/jetkvm/jetkvm/backing/survey_responses) (make sure you're logged into the correct Kickstarter account).

This process helps us stay organized and ensures your JetKVM is shipped to the right place!

### When will I receive my JetKVM?

As the delivery of your JetKVM pledge depends on so many factors, mostly out of our control, we can only provide you with a rough estimate of the dispatch of your device.

**December Batch:**
The first rewards for backers in this group have already started shipping and are being dispatched on an ongoing basis. Additionally, we will start dispatching rewards to backers with extensions in their pledge, starting no later than next week.

**January Batch:**
This batch will begin shipping in January 2025.

**February Batch:**
This batch will begin shipping in February 2025.

Keep in mind that we don't send out every reward at once, but rather continuously over the target month.

### How do I know when my package is dispatched?

Once a package is dispatched from the factory in Shenzhen, China, you will receive a notification email at the shipping email address you provided in the backer survey. Please ensure you've completed the survey.

We will also send you updates via email as your package makes its way to you. Depending on the courier, the shipping notification email will include a tracking link.

If you have filled out the survey, but haven't received an email, it means your reward hasn't been shipped yet.

### What courier will you use?

Unfortunately, we can't specify the courier for any country, as shipping is handled by a third-party service rather than directly by us. If this is a critical requirement for you, and you'd like a refund, please reach out to [shipping@jetkvm.com](mailto:shipping@jetkvm.com). When we launch on Amazon in February, details like this will be much clearer.

### Will you be able to handle the demand?

**Yes!**

Batch production has been happening throughout November 2024, and we have secured the components needed to meet the
projected order volume.
