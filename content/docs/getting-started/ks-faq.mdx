### Which batch am I in?

The batch your in depends on the backer number.

- **December**: Less than 12208
- **January**: 12208 - 15303
- **February**: 15304 - 19415
- **March**: Larger than 19415

### When will I receive my JetKVM?

**We don't know.** We understand the wait can be frustrating, but rest assured, we are working around the clock to get your packages out.

For more context:

As the delivery of your JetKVM pledge depends on so many factors, **mostly out of our control**, we can only provide you with a rough estimate of the dispatch of your device.

**December Batch:** Less than 0.2% of this batch is still pending. These are mostly orders requiring manual handling due to unusual delivery requirement. Feel free to reach out to [shipping@jetkvm.com](mailto:shipping@jetkvm.com)

**January Batch:** Fewer than 1% of these pledges are left. Like the December batch, these are mainly orders with special manual handling needs or unique shipping destinations. Feel free to reach out to [shipping@jetkvm.com](mailto:shipping@jetkvm.com)

**February Batch:** We are actively shipping these orders right now. If you haven’t received a shipping confirmation yet, hang tight - it’s on the way.

**March Batch:** We expect this batch to be dispatched in March, with no delays.

**Important Reminders:**

- If you haven't received an email yet, it just means your reward hasn't been packaged & processed yet. Hang tight, we'll get to you as son as possible!

- We don’t ship all rewards at once. Instead, shipments go out continuously starting in the target month. If your order is in a pending batch, rest assured we’ll get to you soon!

- If you ordered any extensions, we will very likely ship them separately from your main JetKVM device. You'll receive another notification when your extensions are ready to ship.

### How do I know when my package is dispatched?

Once a package is dispatched from the factory in Shenzhen, China, you will receive a notification email at the shipping email address you provided in the backer survey. Please ensure you've completed the survey.

We will also send you updates via email as your package makes its way to you. Depending on the courier, the shipping notification email will include a tracking link.

If you have filled out the survey, but haven't received an email, it means your reward hasn't been shipped yet.

### Kickstarter vs. Retail

JetKVM remains a Kickstarter-backed project, meaning delivery timelines are estimates rather than fixed retail shipping dates. We are preparing for retail availability, but we are not there yet.

Your support made this product possible, and we appreciate your patience as we work to deliver it to you.

### How can I be sure everything is on track?

If you're eager to know whether your package has been dispatched, please:

- Check your email inbox (and spam) for updates from shipping@jetkvm.com.
- Check your Kickstarter Status [here](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/jetkvm/jetkvm/backing/details).

Once it’s ready, you’ll get emails at every step, including when it’s handed off to the courier (with a tracking link).

### What does my Kickstarter status mean?

Your [Kickstarter status](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/jetkvm/jetkvm/backing/details) has 4 variations, let's try to explain what they all mean in the context of JetKVM:

- Not Provided - you're still in the queue
- Not Specified - you're still in the queue
- In Progress - is currently being packaged & processed
- Shipped - on its way to you

If you have "Not Provided" or "Not Specified" - don't worry, your JetKVM is still in the queue and will be handled as soon as possible!

### Can I still make a pledge?

**Yes!**

You can make a late pledge to the campaign on [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/jetkvm/jetkvm?ref=5sxcqi).
Rewards from late pledges will be part of a March 2025 batch of devices.

### Will there be a retail version of JetKVM? How much will it cost?

**Yes**, we're currently in talks with Amazon to sell the JetKVM.

We plan to **keep the $69 price**, before shipping and taxes.
The final price will vary based on your location and available shipping options.

### I never provided my shipping address. How do I do that?

To ensure everything is properly tracked in Kickstarter's system, you'll need to submit your address through the Kickstarter backer survey.

You should have received an email with the survey link, but you can also access it directly here: [Kickstarter Survey Link](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/jetkvm/jetkvm/backing/survey_responses) (make sure you're logged into the correct Kickstarter account).

This process helps us stay organized and ensures your JetKVM is shipped to the right place!

### What courier will you use?

Unfortunately, we can't specify the courier for any country, as shipping is handled by a third-party service rather than directly by us. If this is a critical requirement for you, and you'd like a refund, please reach out to [shipping@jetkvm.com](mailto:shipping@jetkvm.com). When we go retail in March, details like this will be much clearer.

### Will you be able to handle the demand?

**Yes!**

Batch production has been happening throughout November 2024, and we have secured the components needed to meet the
projected order volume.
